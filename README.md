# Survey form with React
Typeform-like survey to collect data using React State. The survey was made into a mad lib where the input is displayed in a story about a dragon.

## The problem

I would like to have the input as required as  a next step. Now only the first question is required, where there is only one input option for name. This was made by setting the form input as required. I tried to solve the other questions by making requirements to the onSubmit function but it didnt work.
